******************************************
Introduction to the RDC tool
******************************************

The ROCm Data Center tool (RDC) simplifies the administration and addresses key infrastructure challenges in AMD GPUs in cluster and datacenter environments. The main features are:

* GPU telemetry
* GPU statistics for jobs
* Integration with third-party tools
* Open source

You can use the RDC tool in standalone mode if all components are installed. However, the existing management tools can use the same set of features available in a library format.

For details on different modes of operation, refer to *Starting RDC* in :ref:`rdc-install`.

Target Audience
===============

The audience for the AMD RDC tool consists of:

* Administrators: RDC provides the cluster administrator with the capability of monitoring, validating, and configuring policies.
* HPC Users: Provides GPU-centric feedback for their workload submissions.
* OEM: Add GPU information to their existing cluster management software.
* Open source Contributors: RDC is open source and accepts contributions from the community. 

Objective
=========

This documentation will:

#. Introduce the tool features in :ref:`rdc-features`
#. Describe integration with external tools in :ref:`rdc-3rd-party`
#. Provide an open source handbook in :ref:`rdc-handbook`
#. Introduce elements of the tool API in :ref:`api-intro`
